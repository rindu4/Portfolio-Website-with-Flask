Objective:
Build a simple personal portfolio site to showcase your profile, skills, and projects, with a contact form.

Tools Used:

Python + Flask → for backend routing and handling form submissions

HTML + CSS → for frontend structure and styling

Key Features:

Home Page – Displays your name, introduction, and list of projects.

Contact Page – Contains a form (Name, Email, Message).

When submitted, the form prints the message details in the console (can be later extended to save in a database or send via email).

Flask Routing – / for Home and /contact for Contact page.

Static CSS – Adds styling (navigation bar, sections, background, and form design).

Deliverable:
A Flask project folder that can be run locally. Visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/ opens the portfolio site.
